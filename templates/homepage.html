		<h1>Coding Patterns in Django</h1>
		<h2>About this site</h2>
		<p>I created Django Patterns.com in response to a talk proposal rejection 
		from DjangoCon.us. Although I was not privy to the exact discussion, 
		reviewers and organizers felt a <a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-pluggable-django-patterns-4900929" title="Pluggable Django Patterns">previous talk I had 
		presented at PyCon in 2011</a> presented &ldquo;non-standard and 
		controversial practices were framed as the normal and accepted ways of 
		doing things&rdquo;. Obviously this &ldquo;raised concerns of misleading 
		less experienced developers&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>As a result, I want to provide a space where solutions to common Django
		    problems are presented thoroughly and discussed <em>openly.</em>
		</p>
		<p>In short, this site&rsquo;s goals are:
		    <ul class="simple">
		        <li>Provide a place look up a pattern for doing something</li>
		        <li>Get a clear explanation of how, when, why to use it</li>
		        <li>Provide for feedback and open discussion of the pattern by the community</li>
		        <li>Allow anyone to contribute patterns</li>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<h2>How to contribute</h2>
		<p>There are several ways to contribute:
		    <ul class="simple">
		        <li>Comment and discuss patterns on the site</li>
		        <li>Suggest improvements to the site</li>
		        <li>Submit new patterns</li>
		        <li>Add to or enhance existing patterns</li>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Comment and discuss patterns on the site</h3>
		<p>Please contribute your ideas, pros and cons of patterns using the
		    <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments form on each page.</p>
		<p>Here are some guidelines:
		    <ul class="simple">
		        <li>Be courteous.</li>
		        <li>Comment on the pattern or idea, not the person submitting.</li>
		        <li>Be helpful in your feedback</li>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Suggest improvements to the site</h3>
		<p>In order to be a good community resource, I welcome any ideas to 
		    improve the site. The best way is to open an issue on 
		    <a href="https://github.com/coordt/djangopatterns.com/issues">the GitHub</a>
		    repository for the site.
		</p>
		<p>The site&rsquo;s code is open source, and licensed under the BSD license,
		    so feel free to contribute code, or just use the code for your own site.
		</p>
		<h3>Submit new patterns</h3>
		<p>
		    The Django Patterns content is actually a 
		    <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> project. Its code is
		    <a href="https://github.com/coordt/djangopatterns">on GitHub</a>.
		    Fork the repository and add your pattern. There is an <tt>example_pattern.rst</tt>
		    file with a basic outline. Then submit a pull request.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Every complete submission will be accepted, even if I personally 
		    disagree with the pattern. I reserve the right to make exceptions
		    to what is accepted in the future, and will do so publicly. As 
		    editor of the site, I may edit your submission for clarity, grammar, 
		    and such.
		</p>
		<h3>Add to or enhance existing patterns</h3>
		<p>
		    Follow the same instructions for submitting a new pattern: fork the 
		    <a href="https://github.com/coordt/djangopatterns">djangopatterns repository</a>,
		    make the changes, and submit a pull request.
